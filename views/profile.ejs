            <h2>Services</h2>
            <p>Creating a platform where individuals can list their books as a library and others can search and locate
                them is a great idea for a library website. Here are some dummy services that you could offer on your
                library website:
                <br>
                1. **Library Registration:**<br>
                Allow individuals or organizations to register their libraries on the platform. They can provide
                information about the library's name, location, operating hours, and contact details.
                <br>
                2. **Book Listing:**<br>
                Registered libraries can list their books by providing details such as title, author, genre, publication
                year, ISBN, and a brief description. They could also upload cover images for the books.
                <br>
                3. **Search and Browse:**<br>
                Users can search for books based on various criteria like title, author, genre, or ISBN. They can also
                browse through categories and genres to discover new books.
                <br>
                4. **Location Mapping:**<br>
                Provide a map interface that displays the locations of registered libraries. Users can see where each
                library is located and get directions to visit them.
                <br>
                5. **Book Availability and Reservation:**<br>
                Users can check the availability of a specific book at different registered libraries. If a book is
                available at multiple libraries, they can choose the most convenient one. Users could also have the
                option to reserve a book for a specific period.
                <br>
                6. **User Reviews and Ratings:**<br>
                Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for books they have borrowed from various libraries. This helps
                other users make informed decisions when selecting books.
                <br>
                7. **Library Recommendations:**<br>
                Provide personalized book recommendations based on a user's reading history, preferences, and ratings.
                <br>
                8. **Library Events and Workshops:**<br>
                Libraries can list upcoming events, workshops, book clubs, and other literary activities. Users can
                browse and participate in these events.
                <br>
                9. **User Profiles:**<br>
                Allow users to create profiles where they can keep track of their borrowed books, wishlist, favorite
                libraries, and reviews.
                <br>
                10. **Communication Platform:**<br>
                Provide a messaging system that allows users to communicate with libraries, ask questions about book
                availability, or request special orders.
                <br>
                11. **Admin Dashboard:**<br>
                A dashboard for library administrators to manage their book listings, update library information, and
                handle user inquiries.
                <br>
                12. **Mobile App Integration:**<br>
                Create a mobile app version of the website for users to easily access library services on the go.
                <br>
                13. **Advanced Search Filters:**<br>
                Enhance the search functionality with filters like language, format (ebook, print), and reading level.
                <br>
                14. **API Integration:**<br>
                Offer an API that allows developers to integrate your library services into other applications or
                websites.
                <br>
                15. **Social Sharing and Bookmarking:**<br>
                Allow users to share their favorite books, libraries, and events on social media platforms, as well as
                bookmark items for future reference.
                <br>
                Remember, these are just dummy services to help you brainstorm. As you develop your library website, you
                can refine and expand these services based on user feedback and needs.!
